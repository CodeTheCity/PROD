# Aberdeen Open Data

## Background
Aberdeen is a city with enormous digital potential. It could be a Smart City. But some of the building blocks are not in place. These include the provision of an Open Data Platform. Comparisons with the other six Scottish cities and with English cities of a similar size, all show Aberdeen is being held back by the city council not prodviding an OD platform. 

Ian Watt has [blogged extenisvely](http://aberdeen.theodi.org/news-blog/) on this. 

## Why are we doing this? 
At [Code The City 11](http://codethecity), we looked at how to raise awareness of this issue. In the absence of a portal, citizens and businesses have nowhere to go for to get properly licenced, machine-readable, neutrally-formatted data. The only way to provide a solution to this is to request datasets one by one. In providing these, the council will need to make sure the data is valid, and so will be able to 

# What we need
Proper open data which is 
* not a PDF, 
* in a neutral, machine-readable format (e.g. CSV not Excel)
* explicitly licensed for re-use (e.g. using the OGL) 
* meets at least 3 stars on the [five star open data sheme[(http://5stardata.info/en/)

# What will we do with it

Anyone can do anything they want with open data. This can include commercial and non-commercial uses. 

But in our case, we want to try to set up some temporary hosting of the data until the city has a properly open data portal.
